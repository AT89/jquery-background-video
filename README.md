# jQuery Background Video
Instantly improve your HTML5 background videos with a single line of jQuery

Built by the folks over at [BG Stock](https://html5backgroundvideos.com) - Premium HTML5 Background Videos

## What does the plugin do?
The plugin does three things
 - Allows you to fade in your video when it starts playing (to avoid a sudden jump)
 - Emulates `background-size: cover;` / `object-fit: contain;`
 - Destroys the video and prevents it downloading on iOS devices (because they can't do background video)
